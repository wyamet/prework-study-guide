# <Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a Bootcamp student I wanted to create an application that I could view and see all of my prework study guide notes. So by building this website I can view what I have learned thus far. It made it easy to have all my notes in one readable web page. I learned How to use multiple coding launguages (HTML,JavaScript,CSS) and Git To create a simple web application.

## Usage

Each section will contain information on either HTML,CSS,GIT, or JavaScript. If we open the dev tools on the webpage it will show us the JavaScript running. Then we can see the topics we learned from the prework and choose a topic for us to study.
